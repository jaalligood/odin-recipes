    <h2>Salisbury Steak Description:</h2>
    <p>Salisbury steaks with a savory onion sauce. This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook but tastes like it took hours to make! I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This Salisbury steak recipe starts with 1.5 pounds of ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned soup:</strong> A can of condensed French onion soup adds moisture, richness, and flavor to the patties. It also serves as the base for the gravy.</li>

        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps hold the patties together.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> These easy Salisbury steaks are simply seasoned with salt and black pepper. Mustard powder enhances the flavor of the gravy.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour thickens the gravy.</li>

    </ul>
